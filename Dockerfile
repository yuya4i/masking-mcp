# ============================================================
# Stage 1: Builder
#   Uses uv to sync the project's dependency tree into a self-
#   contained venv at /opt/venv. The two-step sync (deps first,
#   project second) keeps the heavy dependency layer cacheable
#   across source-only edits.
# ============================================================

# Pin the uv binary by pulling it from Astral's distroless image.
# Bump the tag in lockstep with the host-side uv you develop against
# so local and container behaviour stay aligned.

# 1) Dependency layer — cached unless pyproject.toml / uv.lock change.
#    --no-install-project skips the local package itself so this layer
#    stays stable across source edits.
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock README.md ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --frozen --no-install-project --no-dev

# 2) Project layer — installs the local package on top of the deps.
#    --no-editable copies the source into site-packages, so the
#    runtime stage does not need /build/src on disk.
COPY src ./src
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --frozen --no-dev --no-editable

# 3) spaCy model — baked into /opt/venv here, inherited by both the
#    test and runtime stages so neither has to re-download it.
#
#    `uv run` is critical: spaCy 3.8's downloader auto-detects uv on
#    PATH and subprocesses out to `uv pip install`, which in turn
#    requires VIRTUAL_ENV to be set. Calling `/opt/venv/bin/python`
#    directly would bypass uv run's env injection and fail with
#    "No virtual environment found". `--no-sync` skips uv's implicit
#    pre-run lock check since we just synced one layer up.

# ============================================================
# Stage 2 (optional): Test
#   Built only on explicit request:
#       docker build --target test .
#
#   Forks from `builder`, re-syncs WITH the dev dependency
#   group (pytest, pytest-asyncio, ruff), lays down the spaCy
#   model + tesseract that Presidio / pytesseract expect, and
#   runs the suite. If any test fails the Docker build fails,
#   which makes this a drop-in CI gate. The output image is
#   discarded — `runtime` below is what `docker build .` (no
#   target) produces and what `docker compose` ships.
# ============================================================

# Re-sync WITH dev deps. Two flags are load-bearing:
#   --inexact : the default uv sync mode is strict and would
#               uninstall en_core_web_lg (installed in the builder
#               stage via spaCy's downloader, so it lives in
#               /opt/venv but NOT in uv.lock). --inexact tells uv
#               to leave packages it did not put there alone.
#   --no-editable : match the builder stage's install mode and
#               avoid a silent editable↔non-editable flip of the
#               project on top of an already-built venv.
