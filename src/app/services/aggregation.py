"""Aggregate per-occurrence detections into one entry per unique surface.

The analyzer pipeline emits one :class:`DetectionResult` per occurrence,
which matches the existing extension-facing contract. The UI sidebar
(Milestone 8 Wave A) wants the opposite shape: one row per unique
surface text with an occurrence count and the list of positions, so the
user can tick ``田中太郎 (2件)`` once and have both occurrences masked.

This module is the bridge. The existing ``/v1/extension/sanitize``
endpoint still returns the per-occurrence shape verbatim; the new
``/v1/extension/sanitize/aggregated`` endpoint calls
:func:`aggregate_detections` to build the aggregated view from the
exact same :class:`DetectionResult` list.

Design decisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Aggregation key = surface text only.** Two detections with the
  same ``text`` but different ``entity_type`` (e.g. Presidio's
  ``LOCATION`` vs Sudachi's ``PROPER_NOUN_LOCATION`` firing on the
  same span) collapse into one row. The UI only cares about what the
  string is; the big category resolved from ``entity_type`` via
  :mod:`app.services.category_map` is carried through for display but
  is not part of the key.
* **First occurrence wins the label.** When multiple labels fire on
  the same surface, the one with the lowest ``start`` is kept so the
  ordering is deterministic and does not depend on analyzer iteration
  order. We break further ties by preferring a label whose category
  is not ``"OTHER"`` so the UI's grouping stays useful.
* **Masked flag = at least one occurrence was masked.** A surface is
  considered masked for display purposes when any of its occurrences
  had ``action="masked"``; ``action="allowed"`` on its own still
  reports ``masked=False`` so the UI can show "detected but allowed".
  The force-mask keyword trigger layered on top overrides this to
  ``True``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detections:
        Iterable of per-occurrence detections emitted by
        ``MaskingService.sanitize_text``. The caller is expected to
        feed the ``SanitizeResponse.detections`` list in verbatim.

        One entry per unique surface, ordered by the first occurrence
        of that surface in the original text. Stable ordering matters
        for the UI — the sidebar renders rows in this order and a
        non-deterministic order would cause the list to flicker on
