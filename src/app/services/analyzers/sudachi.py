"""Japanese proper-noun analyzer backed by SudachiPy.

This module is deliberately self-contained: it exposes a small analyzer
class that returns plain dataclass instances and has no dependency on
Presidio at the tokenization layer. The ``MaskingService`` integration
lifts those records into ``RecognizerResult`` objects at call time so
the rest of the pipeline (allow-list filtering, strategy application,
detection reporting) keeps working unchanged.

The analyzer only reports morphemes whose part-of-speech tuple starts
with ``("名詞", "固有名詞", ...)``. Everything else — including the
otherwise plentiful ``("名詞", "一般", ...)`` common nouns — is dropped.
This matches the explicit product requirement:

    形態素解析で固有名詞を抽出してマスクし、一般名詞はマスクしない

``SudachiPy 0.6+`` returns codepoint-based offsets from
``Morpheme.begin()`` / ``Morpheme.end()``, which means the reported
``start`` / ``end`` spans can be used directly to slice the original
Python ``str`` — no byte-to-char translation is needed. The
``tests/test_sudachi_analyzer.py`` suite pins that invariant so a
future SudachiPy regression would fail loudly instead of silently
producing garbled spans.

    Instantiating this class loads the Sudachi dictionary (~50 MB of
    memory), so ``MaskingService`` lazily creates a single instance the
    first time a request opts in to morphological analysis. Subsequent
    calls reuse the same tokenizer.

    The class carries two public responsibilities on purpose:

    * The low-level tokenizer API — ``analyze(text: str)`` — returns a
      list of :class:`SudachiDetection` dataclass instances. Tests and
      anyone who wants raw proper-noun morphemes (with the ``surface``
      field intact) rely on this shape, so it is preserved verbatim
      from the pre-refactor ``sudachi_analyzer`` module.
    * The :class:`app.services.analyzers.base.Analyzer` protocol —
      ``analyze(request: AnalyzerRequest)`` returns a list of
      ``RecognizerResult`` instead, which is what ``MaskingService``
      concatenates with every other analyzer's output before running
      the masking strategy. That adapter used to live inline in
      ``MaskingService.sanitize_text``; hoisting it here means adding a
      new analyzer is a one-file drop-in.

    Runtime dispatch is a plain ``isinstance`` check on the argument,
    which is unambiguous because ``AnalyzerRequest`` is a dataclass and
    ``str`` is, well, a string. Both call sites keep their natural
    ergonomics and neither needs a second method name.
