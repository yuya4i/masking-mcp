"""Analyzer entity label → display-layer big category map.

The analyzers produce fine-grained entity labels (e.g.
``PROPER_NOUN_PERSON``, ``EMAIL_ADDRESS``, ``MONETARY_AMOUNT``). The
browser-extension UI groups those into a small handful of big
categories so the sidebar can show one toggle per category instead of
one per label. This module is the single source of truth for that
mapping.

Add a new entry here whenever a new analyzer label is introduced —
especially when extending :mod:`app.services.analyzers.presets`. An
unmapped label falls back to ``"OTHER"`` at runtime rather than
raising, so the aggregation pipeline never blows up on a new label; but
leaving the fallback in place means the UI cannot bucket it with
related categories, so prefer adding the entry over relying on the
fallback.
