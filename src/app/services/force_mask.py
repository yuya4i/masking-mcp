"""Force-mask keyword trigger for the aggregated extension endpoint.

When the input text contains a sensitive-context keyword like ``リーク``
/ ``未公開`` / ``機密`` / ``confidential`` / ``leak``, the categories in
``RuntimeConfig.force_mask_categories`` are force-masked regardless of
what the user's ``allow_entity_types`` says or what the UI toggled off.
This is the "red-flag words" safety net discussed in the Milestone 8
spec — the user asked for it because a leaker who types
``"リーク情報: 田中太郎の給料"`` into an LLM prompt should have the name
and amount masked even if they accidentally untick them.

Two match modes coexist in :func:`detect_force_mask_trigger`:

* **Japanese keywords** are checked via Sudachi POS. A keyword fires
  only when at least one morpheme's surface equals the keyword AND its
  POS starts with ``"名詞"``. Pure string-``in`` matching is not
  enough because a keyword like ``機密`` could appear as part of a
  longer word or in a verb inflection where firing the trigger would
  be surprising.

* **ASCII keywords** (``"leak"``, ``"confidential"``, …) fall back to
  case-insensitive substring matching because Sudachi only tokenizes
  Japanese. This is the pragmatic compromise called out in the spec.

The module is deliberately standalone — it depends only on
:class:`SudachiProperNounAnalyzer` (which is already cached by
``MaskingService``) and on the ``category_map`` for mapping the
configured categories back to the aggregated entities.
