        a 1-based counter scoped to the entity type. Numbering follows
        left-to-right order of first occurrence and is **stable for a

        the same entity type, both occurrences share the same number.

        mentions as the same referent, and is the building block for a

    Presidio + Sudachi can sometimes flag the same Japanese span twice —
    e.g. a ``LOCATION`` from Presidio's English NER and a
    ``PROPER_NOUN_LOCATION`` from Sudachi on the same character range.
    Keeping both would produce duplicate entries in ``detections`` and,
    worse, the ``partial`` and ``hash`` masking strategies would mutate
    the same offsets twice. This resolver keeps partial overlaps intact
    (they may legitimately describe different pieces of information) but
    discards any entry that is a strict subset of another with a higher
    score. Ties stay deterministic: the first entry wins.

    The implementation is a single linear sweep-line over results
    sorted by ``(start ascending, end descending)``. That sort order
    guarantees every candidate's potential dominator appears strictly
    before it in the walk:

    * If ``prior.start < candidate.start``, then length is strict by
      construction whenever ``prior.end >= candidate.end``.
    * If ``prior.start == candidate.start``, the ``-end`` secondary
      key puts the longer span first, so again any prior with
      ``prior.end > candidate.end`` has strictly greater length; a
      tied ``(start, end)`` pair is *not* considered dominance.

    The sweep maintains a single running "envelope" — the strongest
    dominator seen so far, identified by ``(end, score)``. Each
    candidate is checked against the envelope in O(1); if it survives,
    it optionally replaces the envelope when it extends further or
    matches the end with a strictly higher score. The final complexity
    is ``O(n log n)`` dominated by the sort plus an ``O(n)`` sweep —
    a clean improvement over the previous ``O(n²)`` nested scan on
    payloads with hundreds of detections.
