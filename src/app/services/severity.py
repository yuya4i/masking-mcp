"""Risk-tier classification for entity labels.

Orthogonal to :mod:`category_map` (display bucket) and
:mod:`classification` (linguistic tier). This module answers
"how bad is it if THIS surface leaks?" so the UI can color-code
rows and guard the highest-risk ones behind a long-press gesture.

Four tiers, highest first:

``critical``
    Identity theft / financial compromise / production credentials.
    MY_NUMBER, PASSPORT, DRIVERS_LICENSE, CREDIT_CARD, BANK_ACCOUNT,
    API_KEY, SECRET, DB_CONNECTION.

``high``
    Directly personally identifying. PERSON / PROPER_NOUN_PERSON,
    EMAIL_ADDRESS, PHONE_NUMBER, ADDRESS (full address),
    PATIENT_ID (medical record).

``medium``
    Structured organizational or monetary data that is sensitive
    but not a direct identity vector. LOCATION / COMPANY / org
    names, EMPLOYEE_ID / MEMBER_ID / CUSTOMER_ID / CONTRACT_NUMBER /
    INVOICE_NUMBER / PURCHASE_ORDER / INTERNAL_ID, MONETARY_AMOUNT /
    ANNUAL_INCOME, URL, IP_ADDRESS, PATENT_NUMBER, ASSET_NUMBER,
    LICENSE_NUMBER, DEPARTMENT, PROPER_NOUN_LOCATION /
    PROPER_NOUN_ORG.

``low``
    Broad attributes, partial identifiers, noisy heuristics.
    AGE, GENDER, DATE, BLOOD_TYPE, POSTAL_CODE, SKU,
    KATAKANA_NAME (has high false-positive rate), any label
    not otherwise mapped.
